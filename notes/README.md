# notes

The `notes` subfolder is a bit of a dumping ground, honestly. Preparing experiments, randomly scribbling, or something else like that, you can make a subfolder and do that here. Try and keep it contained, and upgrade it to an `analysis` if you end up actually using it of course! Subfolder names should be prepended with the date so we have at least an idea of age.

This is a place where (Jupyter) notebooks are generally started.
